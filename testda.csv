4,I've had my Fire HD 8 two weeks now and I love it. This tablet is a great value.We are Prime Members and that is where this tablet SHINES. I love being able to easily access all of the Prime content as well as movies you can download and watch laterThis has a 1280/800 screen which has some really nice look to it its nice and crisp and very bright infact it is brighter then the ipad pro costing $900 base model. The build on this fire is INSANELY AWESOME running at only 7.7mm thick and the smooth glossy feel on the back it is really amazing to hold its like the futuristic tab in ur hands.
5,"I bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit. I set it up with her as the user, entered her age and name and now Amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age. Simple to do and she loves the capabilities. I also bought and installed a 64gig SD card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage. For the price I think this tablet is best one out there. You can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost."

4,"Great tablet for under $100. Does not have the highest specs, but gets the job done for lite tablet users."
4,"I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset."
4,This fire tablet has long battery life. Reasonable fast

5,"I did not want to get a new kindle but my old one would not charge or show a charge anymore. I could not depend on it for any length of time so I finally broke down and bought a new one. I am very happy with this one. I was afraid I would lose my music and photos since not all came from the Amazon store. However, everything I had on the old kindle transferred to the new one. I am still learning all about it but so far so good."
5,My daughter likes this tablet to play her online games!
4,Easy to figure out and used it extensively on my vacation.
5,"Excellent tablet to leave at my easel and display reference photos. It's light enough to velcro to a articulating stand (so I can position the tablet right next to my canvas). It's cheap enough to not worry about. I love it, for the price."
5,I bought this wanting for books comics and movies and it has not disappoint ever since
5,My 4 year old Grandson loves his Kindle. He had to have one after his sister got one.

5,"this is a great tablet for the price. my kid loves it ,does alot reading on it."

4,Bought as a Christmas gift for someone. I bought iPad as well. Will update when it's used.
5,Great tablet for the price. It is easy to navigate.
5,I believe that this will be very useful during my husbands recovery from foot surgery.

4,Decent tablet. Access to kindle and pretty much all your google apps.
5,I am very happy with this tablet. The worst thing is that my steals it all the time. Lol

5,Amazing tablet with fast processor. It looks great... got good deal
5,We got this for our 5 year old and this is really great for the price. Works like a charm!!
5,"I find it easy to use, but the kindle does not come with instructions, so you have to find your way around."
4,"I bought this because I was tired of watching Youtube and Twitch on my phone. Excellent display sound is decent-not great but you can always buy a speaker. The negatives are-it is definitely a fingerprint magnet, and the Spectrum TV app is AWFUL-the app works fine on my phone, but for some reason on this tablet it freezes and is unusable. All things considered, for 65 bucks it's hard to be beat."
5,"I love this tablet. The battery life last a long time. I use my Amazon Kindle Fire predominately for watching movies on Amazon Prime, Netflix's, and checking my emails. I also carry it to my appointments and meetings. It is a compact tablet, and not big and bulky. The playback of the movies are great, and the movies are HD. Great little tablet if you are looking for something to watch movies and checking emails. I would definitely recommend this tablet to friends and family members."
5,"My daughter loves this kindle, she does so much with it,well worth the money."
5,Was looking for a tablet that was highly portable & could run my DIRECTTV app & stream videos. (Other electronics I have are much older versions). Salesman recommended this model to me based on personal experience. I am still learning all its functions but so far it seems easy to use & is doing what it promised to do.
5,"This is my second Fire, the other one is now retired. I like having HD. Works just fine."
5,My wife bought this for me for my birthday. I enjoy reading biographys which usually have color photos. The regular Kindle make the pics black and white or they're aren't any. This allows me to see the color photos. I also love the night feature when I'm in bed reading. I no longer need a light on to read or need to hold a large book.
5,"Thanks to a knowledgeable, low-pressure salesperson, I was ready to buy my first tablet. This one was the right price (on sale) and I have not been disappointed. Every few days I learn more ways to use it besides checking e-mails & checking out library books & audio books. It stays charged for days, even with regular use. I recommend it as an inexpensive and very satisfactory alternative to more expensive tablets."
5,"It's a great tablet for the price. Don't expect it to be as fast more expensive ones. It's meant for casual use and it does a great job at that. For the price, you can't beat it. Get a nice large microsd card and you don't have to worry about space. It runs a little slow on certain things if you are multitasking but it's a simple tablet. I've run plenty of 720p videos without fail. It's great for ebooks or other files. Some more elaborate pdfs take a while to load if they have a lol of graphics. Battery life seems good for a small table too.The only real Issue I have is the Amazon App store being limited. It is an offshoot of Android but not all the same apps are available. There is a way around it but I wish they would just allow it access to Google Play or at least offer the same apps.So, it's a nice inexpensive table that works great. For the money, you will love it but don't get upset that is doesn't run as fast as a $500 tablet. That's not its job."
4,Bought it for my 10 yr old granddaughter. Does everything she wants it to do in a tablet.
5,Very easy to use tablet. Lots of apps and game available.
5,"We love the FreeTime settings for kids on the newer Kindle Fires. I was able to create a login for each of our kids as well as myself and set limits to the amount of device time they are allowed daily (can set to more for weekends if desired). You can set the age restrictions for content also, to avoid inappropriate ads, etc. Once you've downloaded apps, you can choose which ones you want each child to have access to in their profile settings, so if one child is older you can allow them access to something their younger siblings shouldn't have. Basically, I like that I can set their access rights and know they're safe so I don't have to continually monitor every moment. By the way, FreeTime kids settings are available without having to subscribe to their FreeTime app access plan. :)"
5,"Great tablet, very clear picture. Would buy again."
4,Good reader which is why I bought it. Ads are annoying.
4,"It's a mini computer packed in a handheld devise. Applications load quickly and I am able to get my work completed, while riding the commuter rail."
4,Nice for a smaller tablet. It's good for Internet surfing.
5,"Purchased as a door prize gift given with a one year Amazon membership. The recipient loves it and says it performs very well. (As a past Amazon Fire user, now i-Pad graduate, I loved my Amazon Fire for more than 4 years without any problems. In fact, I just recycled it on to my son and it runs like a champ)."
5,"I have 4 other kinds of tables. This the best I have had. I can listen to music, read a book, listen to a book, or watch movies/tv shows."
5,Great product for the kids gaming apps parental controls to make sure you can monitor kids and prevent unwanted app purchases
5,I purchased 2 of these tablets for my 6 and 8 year old. They were a Black Friday special for $59. They are perfect for the apps and games they wanted.
5,Great product. Love the Amazon ecosystem. The Freetime subscription is a must
5,"Needed something a bit larger than the 6+ to stream Netflix, this was perfect!"
5,"my husband bought this for me as a Christmas present. I couldn't understand why he bought it because I already have a Kindle Fire.Once I opened it and got it going, I loved all it could do plus the graphic is so much colorful than my older Kindle."
5,my grandson-8-loves this --the games and the books!
4,Great product and I'm very satisfied with it. I recommend it to other people.
4,I purchased this tablet for my niece for Christmas and she love it.
5,"Easy to use, responds quickly, great screen brightness."
4,Great tablet but apps limited comparison of other tablets.
5,Works as we thought it should. NO PROBLEMS. Good buying experience.
4,"We have the smaller one, and been great. This one is even better, because of the size."
5,"I am a prime member & I love this tablet. Very user friendly especially if you are a prime member with amazon. Not real tech savvy so I need all the help I can get to keep things simple & automatic. Great clarity of picture/data. Have a 10"" tablet and wasn't sure about downgrading size (old eyes) but was delighted to see it works fine at 8"" instead of 10"". Also, easier to take around in the smaller size. Highly recommend especially if you subscribe to Amazon and are a prime member. Great benefits!!"
5,Got this for my wife. She loves the bigger screen and the better app management features that this one has over her earlier generation kindle. Definitely worth it!
5,"Connects to home WiFi automatically. Many books, and many games. Actually functions like a computer tablet. E-mail is a breeze."
5,"Bought this to replace no-name budget tablet for my daughter. She loves this as it is much faster and has a better display than her old tablet. This is a wonderful value as it is faster, has a better display and sound, is a name brand and cost about the same ... what's not to love about this product?"
5,"She loves this tablet. It works well unlike her ""bargain"" tablet which she tried to use previously and cost about the same. She likes the sound of it also! She enjoys the free games she downloaded and navigates the wev easily with it."
4,"It's no iPad, but it's great for Netflix and some app games. I'm not worried about the kids getting their paws on it since it's relatively inexpensive."
2,Didn't have some of the features I was looking for. Returned it the next day. May be good for others
5,I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. It's speedy when loading books!
4,Purchased for my wife who reads a lot and truly enjoys the amazon fire.
4,"A great Christmas gift, the kids love the gifts..."
5,"Daughter got this as a present. It was easy to set up and display is great. Features allow us to limit her time on games, web, etc. while allowing her unlimited time to read"
5,I have enjoyed just learning how to use it. You're never too old to learn new things.
5,bought for husband and he was surprised it does the work he needs it for
5,This was a birthday present and it was ideal for a traveler to read ebooks on while on the rood
5,"My teenage daughter enjoyed her three year old 7"" Kindle for recreation but wanted a larger screen for word processing. Paired this with a Bluetooth keyboard and she was thrilled."
1,"i Bought this around black friday for $60 hoping it would be awesome... it failed so hard i tried multiple different micro SD cards none of which were recognized and YES i formated them with every format i could think of ... Fat32, NTFS, Fat, Xfat... i even tried to have the tablet do it... didnt work... to make matters worse half the apps i wanted to use werent in the app store and i came to find out that it isnt linked to the normal google play store this tablet has its own app store which is missing many common apps... the main reason i bought this was to play clash of clans and i cant because it wasnt on the app store... i tried to also use aftermarket play stores to play COC but it didnt work... launched and played 1 time but didnt work or update after that... needless to say i returned it and bought a $250 samsung galaxy tab A 10.1 (2016 version) with S-pen and its WAYYYYY better... bottom line you get what you pay for... also hint the s-pen version has an extra 1 GB of ram over the non pen version... so you should get that if you can afford the extra $50..."
5,The People I purchased this for during Christmas Holiday LOVED IT...
5,"I purchased two of these for my kids, ages 12 and 10. Forget the IPod touch. For the price, this tablet can't be beat! They can download games, books and movies for free all included with my Amazon Prime membership. Awesome!!"
5,my kids enjoy the Fire HD and they love the picture quality
4,Bought two of these tablets for my nieces for Christmas after we had originally bought the Amazon fire 7 inch which had a virus after 3 days of purchase and was unable to work good thing we played with it prior to giving as gift do to this being said I was very surprised on how well this tablet has held up to to not so careful 8 years olds playing with it daily we have had no problems screen is big enough for little hands to maneuver and see on was the highlight of there Christmas and still is would definitely recommend it
5,Really like the updates this product has in comparison to my first one
5,Functionality and ease of use are outstanding right out of the the box. Super clear screen and weight is minimum and is a joy to use.

5,My god sister has been using these for years.What to read more!
5,"The latest Amazon 8"" HD tablet is a very good tablet for the price. The updated processor and extra memory (with expansion slot) allow for very good performance on all that we use this tablet for. Netflix, Hulu, browsing the internet, and doing e-mails all work very smoothly. Would recommend to anyone looking for a very cost effective tablet"
5,"totally worth the money, has all the apps I use on a daily basis!"
5,Good tablet. Wife loves it and would recommend....

5,"Amazon Fire HD8 is a great product for the price. I picked it up for $69 during the holiday shopping season. Replacing a 1st gen Samsung Tab 2. This thing is sooo much faster. Perfect size for reading Kindle books , emails, and doing the social media thing."

4,"My 6 yr old daughter got this tablet from Santa for Christmas. So far she loves it, a little too much perhaps.. I only use it to manage her account/permissions and so far haven't had any issues with it.. Software and HW not quite as refined as apple iPad products, but what can you expect at the lower price point."
4,"my opinion its a good option for the cost. Not as great as Apple Ipad, but it costs so much less. Still can get good use"
5,"Has many educational apps I would definitely go into the settings if you're a mother like me who Is a very strict of what your children watch on TV or what games and apps they download I would definitely recommend setting the parental controls before giving it to them. In my personal opinion as a mother I feel it helps by setting the restrictions/content on It helps keep their mind away from the gutter Bcuz most apps and Internet websites have inappropriate sites children should not be watching. We can't control what they put on the Internet but we can control what our children watch and download they stay very occupied on educational apps ,read books most of these apps are free to I also recommend NOT putting a payment method option other than that my kids loved it"
4,"the hd feature is what sold me on this product, along with the fact its a lotmore streamline than the older version that I have"
5,"Very nice for light internet browsing, keeping on top of email, viewing videos, and reading e books, which I like to get free from the library. Good browser, good battery power, fast charge.

1,I bought this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. Too many advertisements. I would rather pay more and not have a single ad.
5,This is a step up from what my son was using. He said it does well and easy to use.
4,This is a good tablet for kids who are starting off
5,I bought this for my 6 year old and it's perfect. Faster & clearer than older versions.
5,Awesome good size large enough for games and photos
5,Great gift easy to use and she loves being able to take it anywhere
5,"I bought this to replace the 7 inch version I lost in the airport. I wanted the bigger screen and the higher resolutions. It is much when loading games in offline mode as well as videos I have downloaded from Amazon Prime to play on the plane when wifi is not available. That was a plus for me. And now that the updated Netflix app allows the same thing, I have plenty of videos. I can also play my .mp4 videos using VLC player that I load to a microSD card. Of course you have wifi and Bluetooth so great for surfing try he net or listening to music. The 8 in screen is perfect for lying in bed and watching my show. I highly recommend this."

5,"My daughter love her new tablet, I use for a few days and it's pretty good"

4,This product is very handy on the go. I can check emails and find work for my truck.
5,"I am an Amazon Fan. Ive only had Amazon tablets so I cant compare them with any other brand. But, Amazon has great customer service, a lot of great apps. The HD 8 is a great tablet for watching movies, most games, and social media. Its not as good as the Kindle fire hdx. The speakers arent as good, the hdx has more of a surround sound, but the hd 8 is less expensive, has a place for a sims card for extra space, and has an ok front and rear facing camera. Overall its a great tablet for a great price."
5,"I previously had bought an older model of these tablets for my children. I wasn't to happy with them. But this tablet is great, it has child safety features like wether you would like to have them surf the web to even limiting the amount of hours your child can use it. Very good tablet for what my kids will use it for which is mostly Netflix Hulu and even though there isn't you tube app there are alternate apps that acces you tube."
5,"Got this tablet for Black Friday. Wow, 16 gigs, great screen, expandable memory, what a deal. Tablet is a must have for Amazon Prime members. It unlocks the door for all those great Prime perks; books, shows, and shopping. Pairs to Alexa. Great screen for books! Buy it already!"
4,Bought it on black Friday for 60$ .Value for money tablet. It lags at heavy tasks and also apps are reloaded when 2-3 apps are opened at same time. But at this price it is expected. Go for it if budget is <100$.
4,overall this is a good tablet. it is best with those who have Prime Amazon and the ability to watch Amazon video. a good price for a good tablet but has limitations based on the operating system. for video watching and basic use a good choice
5,I love the size and portability of this. Keeps me in touch and having fun.
5,Nice tablet and couldn't beat the Black Friday price
5,I'm sorry I didn't buy it sooner! Very easy to use. Love it.
5,"It feels a bit more rugged than my original Fire tablet, and I believe it is an excellent value."
4,Good tablet for basic needs. Screens resolution is pretty good. Mostly using for reading and sometimes for watching movies/shows. Great feature is the possibility to use the card to expand the memory. Good product for great price!
4,Bought as a gift for my 86 yr old mom to stalk her kids and grandkids on FB. She mastered it in a few.minutes with minimal instruction. Now I have to watch my posts.
5,For a cheaper price this does more than my kindle- love having this tablet
5,Had a smaller version. Love the bigger screen. Use this product more than a computer.
5,I bought 2 of the kindles for my grandsons. They love them! Had them charged and set up right away. No issues at this point.
4,"Easy to use bought for our 5 year old, found a case which allows him to keep it safe."
4,Great 8 inches tablet with and amazing storage for apps.
5,Santa dropped this off for our 4th grader along with expanded memory. he uses it for Netflix and Youtube as well as Minecraft and other Apps. Why spend hundreds on something for basic kids needs? I'm sure this will last him a few years and is well worth the price.
5,Got this tablet for my 3 year old son and he can not put it down. It is so much to do. So many learning games. I love this product
4,"This tablet runs smooth with all amazon apps, the internet runs at a steady frame rate and it had a decent sized screen."
5,This is a good device for entertainment and entry level tasks. I think it can do a lot for the price.
5,Nice price for the new model with Alexa built in and expandable storage!
4,"I have enjoyed the new Kindle,however, was extremely disappointed that it does not have an HDMI port like the old version did."
4,this product is really awesome for kids to play in all sorts.We can use a strong case and let kids play in it .
4,i like the features it has and it is easy to navigate.
4,This is perfect my kids to do their school work on and have fun as well.
5,Great gift for my dad. Clear picture and easy set up
5,Love my kindle! Works better than expected! Kindle is much faster than my old tablet!
5,"I have never owned a tablet. Wanted an I-Pad like most, but couldn't afford the sticker price. This one fit my needs perfect. I mainly just use it for web surfing and streaming video. No complaints so far! I would recommend this device."
5,also great for listening to music and also for movies
5,The screen picture is crisp and bright. I will use this tablet for many things.
5,small and powerful... great adult toy for a reader
5,"This was purchased as a Christmas present for my aunt who lives with us. For the price, I thought it would be a good option for her since she doesn't want to drop the cash on an iPad.For comparison, the closest thing I have is an 8"" insignia tablet with similar screen resolution, storage, and features that was released at the same time. The Fire tablet impresses me! It is more responsive than the existing android tablet I have.This tablet runs FireOS which is Amazon's customized version of Android. Typically I do not like custom Android, preferring to have as close to a vanilla system as possible. I am not bothered by that with the Fire. If you need them the parental controls are second to none! The Amazon app store is extensive, although not as extensive as the Google Play store. Still you should be able to find pretty much everything you need there.This is not a flagship device, but performs incredibly for the price. I will most likely be purchasing one soon for myself."
3,I was hoping to use Google launcher with this tablet but it is really locked down and you cannot change the launcher or the lock screen. Still cheap and fine for watching movies.
5,"Great tablet for reading and also surfacing the web, along with your favorite social media apps!"
4,"The price is low because Amazon uses their adds to subsidize the price. The actual tablet works well. The biggest negative is that you can only install apps from the Amazon store. There are many Android Apps available in the google store that are not available in the Amazon store.I primarily use the tablet for bible gateway, dish anywhere, play some games, read the newspaper, and Facebook. In the future I want to try to use it with my local library."
4,Screen is very clear and battery last a long time. Very good substitute if you can afford a iPad.
3,"The tablet works fine. It is responsive with good resolution. It is too tied to Amazon. It requires too many hoops to get apps such as Zinio to work. Until Amazon loosens its grip, I recommend only at a very good price."
5,A Great value for the money you can save instead of a Ipad from Apple.
4,Fun and reliable. Good quality for the money. Easy to use.
5,"Great for reading - nice image, easy on the eyes and lightweight."
5,"Bought this for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas! She LOVES it!!! A great alternative to a pricey iPad Mini!!! She uses it for watching Netflix, YouTube and we use it for homeschool. We are very happy with our purchase!!!"
5,I got this tablet on sale for my wife and she loves it
4,So far so good with the kindle fire hd. still need to play with it to see how to maximize our use.
5,"We love Kindle Fire, we purchase it for an older couple and it's easy to work."
5,The Amazon Fire is a great tablet with awesome graphics. I use it mainly for surfing the web and have had no issues with it.
4,Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. Used it everyday. Very good product and screen size is perfect for him.
5,Great tablet for the price. My granddaughter loves how user friendly it is.
5,got this for my nieces aged 6-13 they loved it and so did their parents really keeps them occupied
5,This was a gift for mom. She enjoys that it's easy to use and has good picture and sound quality. The price was also great
4,"Was wanting a bigger screen, which it is, trying to get use to different applications, so far seems easy."
5,The Amazon fire is simply amazing I would not buy anything else.
1,Didn't want to go to the sites amazon wanted me to.
5,We bought this for our three daughters! Got a kid proof case and added free time for a low monthly fee and couldn't be happier! So much better than worrying about them breaking my phone or iPad!
5,"I love my Kindle. I won't be without one. I've even bought an extra one, just in case. I believe it's the best tablet on the market."
4,Bought one to replace the smaller (non HD) version. Lot faster and picture is noticeably better. Would recommend for anyone not wanting to spend the extra $50 or so on the big names.
5,"Could not have asked for a better tablet for the money. I wasn't looking for anything extreme. Just wanted it to look nice and do it's job for games and browsing. Well it does that and more. Gave it to our son for Christmas and now I want one myself. We are going to buy another for my mother in law. Lightweight, simple layout. Snappy. Can't go wrong."
5,It was a perfect gift for my godson. He loved it! Definitely would recommend this product.
5,I can do a lot of things on my Kindle I used to rely on the computer for.
5,Excellent resource for children video streaming by Wifi using mobile hotspot with kids.
4,"The kindle fire tablets are great for the price. They have solid performance in battery life and processing power. The only downside is that the Operating System is a different variation of Android, so there could be some incompatibilities."
4,best choice under 100$ in marketamazon is the best!!!
4,I really didnt expect how its going to work.but its very good.gifted to my friend
5,Bought this as a gift for my mom and this was to replace her original Kindle Fire. She's have had a month now and is loving and no problems with it.
5,This was a request from our 7 yr old granddaugter who had always asked her older sister if she could share hers due to we bought this same tablet/size a few yrs earlier. Loved the security/parental control options.Starfall a favorite educational app were told is a must have. Really enjoy Pics/Viber due to their in a different state. Also some games on a time limit. Size and resolution are perfect.
4,"This is the best device I have found for my e-books. I know it can be used for a lot more, but it is my library in my hand."
4,"I bought this tablet to be pretty much exclusively an e-reader. It's actually cheaper than most of the kindles. For that limited use, it works fine. I don't think I would want to use it as a general purpose table (too slow!). Makes a fine e-reader though. As for recommending this to a friend, I would, but would make sure they knew what I use it for."
5,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my sister and she LOVES it. It's easy to use, lightweight and doesn't seem to have a lot of bugs or glitches. It's a good source of entertainment for when she's at work but has down-time. She passes the time reading ebooks, browsing the web and playing games."
5,"I originally purchased a Kindle paperwhite but returned it the next day and purchased this one. Very easy to read on, watch movies, and listen to music."
4,Works well. Easy to use. Battery seems to be good. Would buy again.
4,Ticks all the boxes I was looking for at a price I was happy to pay. One caveat that I (or the Best Buy and Geek Squad crews) was unaware of: there is a glitch in the keyboard that prevents it from working properly. Kindle/Amazon are aware of the glitch and will download a third-party keyboard fix to replace the keyboard that's built in to the unit until they are able to fix the problem. I made Geek Squad aware of it and they should know about it now.
4,Amazon MayDay functionality is not available and this was unexpected. Other services and functionality as expected
5,Perfect tablet to take anywhere you go and lighter than my IPad.
5,Easy to use tablet for every day use. Additional apps can help increase productivity for work and daily use.
5,This tablet does all I need a tablet to do. Reason why it's my 3rd one.
5,"Bought this tablet for my fiancÃ©e daughter, after getting it home and set up, I decided to keep it for myself. Great screen and works great with my pair of Amazon echos. I love it and highly recommend it."
5,"This is my first Amazon e-reader-tablet and the second e-reader I have. It is easy to use once you get through the initial hoops. I like the free games and the fact that I new can load books from my computer to the tablet. And one thing, I am not in the market for a tablet but for a bigger e-reader. It is a lot better than the Nook that I have. I love this product"
4,Bought as a gift for parents who aren't tech savy but were able to use it with ease
5,"I have Bought several versions of this tablet for my kids over the years and have been ever impressed with it. I first got one for my son, the my oldest daughter to replace her children's tablet, which was worthless, this tablet gives you everything you could want and allows you to control what your kids access on it and even lets you see what they download onto it. if you want to set a time when it shuts off at night you can, when they can play games or use Netflixs you can...great product!"
5,Great gift for a younger person who wants a tablet
5,The fire is great. The size is really nice. Not to big. The clarity is really good.
5,This inexpensive tablet does everything I want it to do. I can read my books and magazines and keeps tabs on my kids and grandkids on Facebook. Very easy to use and crystal clear pictures and video.
5,"Great entry level tablet for kids or anyone that will not be heavily using a tablet. The 16 GB, is too small but can add an SD card. Beware only comes with 6GB of the 16 for your apps. Comes with bunch of preloaded Amazon apps."
5,This tablet is great. I loved the color and all the features it has. I will be buying more for my daughters. Great purchase
4,"What I expected. A better then budget tablet ata good price. Bought for the integration with Alexa and it works well, more info about your Alexa request will show up automatically on the tablet."
5,It's a excellent tablet for my kid she downloaded games and watch cartoons
5,I was looking for a Good tablet under $100..this delivered..getting used to Amazon apps LOL
5,Excellent ratio quality price. Lightweight. Good resolution and easy to use.

5,Love everything about my Kindle. I'm a long-term Amazon Prime member.
4,Great tablet for the price. My father in law likes the easy use of the tablet.
5,The Fire is an excellent table for many basic tasks.
2,Not a good product short battery life i can only use for 20 minutes
5,"I was looking for something to read on and this fit the bill for the right price.Great screen clarity, good adjustment too. Works well and the battery life is great. Size is nice too. Big enough for 1 hand if needed."
5,"This is a great tablet for books, games and web browsing. It is very user friendly, -and I would definitely recommend this product!"
5,I enjoy to use the reader and like the idea that I can go to the internet from the Kindle.
5,I thought that this tablet was junk but it has surpassed my expectations
5,"I wasn't really expecting much, however I was pleasantly surprised.It feels solid, responsive, screen is good.For the price its a bargain!!"
4,Good if you want something inexpensive and Will do the minimum very well.
5,"I like this ipads for my baby and me too,special and super ok thanks byee"
5,I found it to be very versatile and enjoyable benefiting from a touch screen.
5,Ipad killer! A fierce tablet at a convinient price!
4,bought as a gift she loves it all kinds of apps easy to use and even easyer with amazon prime
4,I bought it as the display for my Echo. Turning on Voicecast routes information to the tablet with the voice reaponse. It'S been exactly what I hoped it would be and the price was right.
5,"This tablet is exactly what I was looking for to take on trips. The kids can watch their movies and videos, or I can read from my kindle library. Perfect size."
5,I bought this as a gift for my son and I know he will love it he has the old kindle fire as likes it a lot
5,"My mom had an old one, she was so excited to get this one."
5,Works great and is fast. Great for reading and internet use
1,"This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. Despite what one of Best Buys' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately, it bogs down. I also don't like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so I won't use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig's List for less than half of what I paid for it."
3,"Fine for reading, ...haven't used it for anything else yet"
5,"I have been using a Kindle Fire for a couple of years. It was a good tablet, until the screen went black. Best Buy replaced it and I couldn't have been more pleased. I enjoy reading on my Kindle Fire HD more than ever. Try it and you'll buy it!"
5,"A viable substitute for the more expensive I Pad especially for kids wanting a tablet. You can download books, games, email and access the internet. Parental controls are easily enabled."
5,blueray is just twhat I was I was looking for great for watching movies thank you
5,Love best buy and I shop at Best Buy I always buy my TV for me and my kids I buy my kids tablets at Best Buy Love Best Buy
5,"Got this for my mom for her birthday, and she absolutely loves it. Great tablet for the price point, good tablet overall."
5,I love all of them. I would recommend going to Best Buy and buying a kindle fire before they are sold out!
4,Nice size screen easy and light weight to take to class
4,This tablet is great for my son. Would be nice if it had a little more horsepower
5,"My 76 year old mom loves this! She now has something to do while waiting in doctors offices - loves to read, do crosswords, etc."
4,I enjoy it more then the I-pad that its replacing. Easy to read in any light and the size is perfect for travel.
5,"I absolutely love my kindle 8! Great picture, storage & sound. Can't live without my kindle!"
1,I liked it at first except the browser is kind of clunky. Also you can. It use all android Apps. The worst thing though was mine just stopped working in the middle of watching a movie on a long plane flight. It was fully charged. I have tried recharging and turning on etc. it is just a blank screen and off. Kind of a cool paperweight. Hope I can get my money back. Or get a new one.
5,Love my mine! Works great with prime! And I have all my best movies!
4,I bought this for my dad in his late 60s mainly to listen to music and read ebooks borrowed from the library. I set it up for him and he loves it. I just don't like that it has ads on the start up unless you pay to get rid of them.
4,Enjoy reading books on it as well as viewing videos.
5,Got two for my mom's and they love it. So many great features!!!
5,this tablet is awesome. the fact that I can use a micro sd card to have more memory and can listen to my content on the card is great. the additional screen size is what I wanted and it has not disappointed. this was a great purchase!!!
5,"I'm very happy with my Kindle Fire. Beyond being able to read books, it does all sorts of things and is able to download a huge variety of apps. It also holds a charge very long. The size is perfect and portable, yet the screen is much larger than a smartphone, which I love. I would definitely recommend this tablet to others!"
5,The Amazon Fire HD 8 is an awesome device. THE PRICE OF THIS TABLET IS MIND BOGGLING!! This tablet has everything you would expect and want in a tablet and more. It has Amazon Store and Amazon Prime preloaded. It's so much fun and so easy to use. THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS TABLET IS UNBELIEVABLE. You never stop thinking about the modest price you paid for such a fantastic tablet. It feels comfortable in your hands. The design is nice. The size is adequate for all tablet use. You can expand the memory storage of this device an additional 240GB. Can you believe it? Outstanding!!
5,Bought as a Christmas present. Son uses it to watch youtube and Netflick. Works great.
4,The overall design makes it fir very nice in the hand. It is very easy to setup and has features that I did not utilize on previous Fire tablets. I like the camera and the Blue Shade ability. I like to read before bed and the color really does help me wind down. Long lasting battery!
5,Got this Fire tablet for my youngest daughter for Christmas and she loves it. I also love the option to restrict apps and content for her age!
5,I bought two of these Amazon Fire HD tablets in December as Christmas gifts. Both recipients are happy with these as gifts. I plan to purchase one in the near future for myself.
5,"Biting as a gift, my only concern was the size and the Amazon interface. It was easy enough to download the Google play store, so it was familiar to the user. Size was an initial concern, but it was just right to watch movies without being so cumbersome."
5,My son really likes the larger screen to play games.
5,Very easy to use and has so much to offer for the low price.
5,"great product, easy to use, love the lighted pad, ease of down loading books,"
5,They were using them on Christmas morning!! It didn't take them long too be getting the best from those tablets
4,So I think I would have rated 5 stars however when I got my tablet home my 8 year old used it for a total of 2hrs...the next day it had a reboot screen similar to Dos windows. Excellent customer service at store allowed me to exchange next day. No problems with the second one. Great tablet for the price.
5,i love it amazon is nice read book on it play games on it
5,I bought this Kindle as a gift for my mother so she could access her Facebook account easily. She loves the ease of using it. I have 3 kindle tablets in my home and they are used daily. My mother uses hers for email and some light gaming and for watching Netflix as well. Very satisfied.
5,I wanted a low cost internet device to feed internet radio choices into my stereo. This fit the bill well. I use the headphone jack to connect with my stereo and get great sound. I don't use most of the other apps that come on the device.
5,"The Kindle Fire is a wonderful, small device to use for a multitude of tasks. We use it mostly as an ereader and has been so simple to use. So happy we chose this one. It is lightweight and convenient to take with you."
5,"I bought this as a temporary replacement for my wife's 11"" Kindle Fire HD that was out for service. She liked this 8"" model so much that she continued using it after the 11"" one returned."
4,"I tested this item before I gave it as a gift. It is simple enough for the needs of browsing, social media and entertainment. Definitely best price for simple needs compared to spending $100s on an iPad"
4,"This feels like an affordable tablet. While not the best in class, it isn't priced to be that either. Works well. Happy with purchase."
4,Great for watching sports events away from home but within wi fi range.
5,So easy to download and then read. Enjoy reading that I can take anywhere without the heaviness of a book
5,"I bought this after subscribing to an Amazon Prime membership. This is a great little tablet at such a low price.. too good of a deal to pass up when it was on sale. It has the ability to talk to Alexa, surf the web, listen to music and read books/magazines (lots of free music and books for Prime members)."
1,"If ads dont bother you, then this may be a decent device. Purchased this for my kid and it was loaded down with so much spam, it kept loading it up making it slow and laggy. Plus the carrasoul loadout makes it hard to navigate for kids, not very kid friendly! Oh you can pay $15 to remove the ads but it wont remove them all. Buy the samsung, better everything!"
5,"This is my second Fire, I'm upgrading from the 2nd generation 7"" model. Love the screen resolution. Movies and videos are sharp and no pixelating. The camera is a bonus my first version did not have. All together this was a great buy for under $100 on sale. Thank you Best Buy."
4,"I would buy it again and have twice over already. I actually bought the kids fire kindle and bought this for my wife, her's was lost and she borrowed my sons kid fire kindle I ended up buying her this again, and would buy it again. I would recommend buying a sd card it fills up fast without out it but it is a lot cheaper to buy the lower GB kindle and then buy a good sd card."
5,"This tablet has it all. Amazon offers tons of free apps, hundreds of thousands of free e-books and tons of free games. The tablet is intuitive and intelligent. I seamlessly enjoy streaming my favorite shows and reading articles, books and periodicals. What I love most is that the tablet doesn't place all apps on the device, but uses the users miro SD card instead for up to 200GB of additional storage for a dizzying amount of storage for more games, apps, books and movies that can be downloaded and enjoyed. It also allows the owner to share the device with family members, delegating each member an account personalized and tailored to that individual. There is even an option to create children's accounts--extra bonus. I am able to mirror the content from the tablet onto my Samsung Smart television. I will definitely consider Amazon first and foremost when making any future tablet purchases. It maintains a charge for a good deal of time, alleviating the need to be near an outlet to enjoy using it. I can charge it in the evening and use it for several hours the next day, sometimes two days. No one will ever create a tablet that is more considerate of the owner/end-user."
5,I love to read and this tablet makes it so easy to carry an entire library with me everywhere. I have also become addicted to the free underground games.
5,"Bought this 8"" model to use in addition to my current 3 year old Kindle Fire HD (7 inch model). So far I am very pleased with the quality of this unit. The slightly larger screen makes watching movies much better. I didn't want the larger 10"" screen (yet)."
5,"I purchased this on Black Friday because I could pass on the price. The tablet works great for basic internet needs and great for shopping on Amazon. If I were to purchase another Android Tablet, I will look for something with a little more power since this tablet slows when multi-tasking."
5,"I bought this for my son (he's 1.5 years old) so he could play basic toddler games, but I found the tablet to be extremely useful for school with it's large screen and super long battery life. I'm waiting for the Surface Pro 5 but this tablet that I got for so cheap is making me second guess paying so much! For basic lecture taking notes and watching Netflix or Hulu and kid games, this can't be beat."
5,The best tablet for the price i use it everyday to watch youtube videos
5,Great purchase for my granddaughter for Christmas.
5,This tablet is perfect for just about anything you could want to do on a tablet.
4,My grandmother enjoys this tablet ... it use as her reader.
5,"Great item at great price, MY WIFE LOVES IT AND WONT PUT IT DOWN!"
5,great black friday deal for a mediocre tablet. android os though!
5,"Wanted a tablet at a cheap price and this item fit the bill. Bought on Black Friday which made the price even better. The screen looks good and the performance for the apps I have used so far have met expectations. I mainly used for surfing the web, youtube, and netflix. This device handles each with ease. Overall, I am satisfied with this device."
5,"Works well; no issues with reboots or system hangs.. Good size - not too big and not too small. Screen is good for reading. Battery life is good, I've bought a few books from Amazon but mostly side-loaded books from the library onto a 32 GB micro sd card."
3,"Though I have got it for cheap price during black friday, this Fire is not that great. Very bad camera and dim screen resolution. Pros:Install Google Play without any hassleVery good book reading option"
5,"I got this for my son and he loves it! He can play games, watch movies, you tube videos, and use the internet for help with homework. He also loves all the books, and aps. Was a great black Friday deal should have gotten one for myself."
4,I got it at a great price. They price matched for me. Much faster then getting my laptop out to check email
5,I purchased this product for my youngest son! He loved the color and the size. The storage is great for the number of activities that he has downloaded!
5,Was looking for a tablet to run my remote music server with from my easy chair. My first tablet I bought at about the same price ran through the battery in an hour. Amazon product is much better for battery life and image quality is very nice.
5,This product is easy to use. Screen size is great. Would recommend to anyone.
5,I got it for my kid and she loves it. The amazon free time and prime well worth the money
5,"Best tablet around, cheaper than most and does just as much as other tablets. Great buy, it works perfect! Battery lasts a few days too."
5,She likes to read books and this is a fast and cheap way for her to do so
5,It's a great buy. Just to read emails and go on the web
5,Great Christmas gifts for the kids. Hours of fun and games.
5,I purchased this tablet mostly for entertainment. I enjoy playing games and this tablet is great for that purpose. Also plan on using it for reading electronic books.
5,Very nice quality product. East to set up and use.
5,So much more screen size than previously kindles. Fast charging. Longer battery life.
5,"Purchased for my mom to read ebooks, great performance, screen looks good, easy to use. Very happy with this purchase."
5,less expensive than last year with so many more features and bigger screen!
5,Bought for my wife for X-mas and she loves it. Hasn't put it down
3,"This is a good product for video, surfing and reading. However this version has dropped all android support as far as I can tell. I have a couple of apps that run on my old Fire just fine but are extremely problematic on this one. There is one app I use everyday but it doesn't work on this new Fire, so I have to keep the old one around. Kind of inconvenient. I would recommend seeing if your app is supported on this Fire before dropping the money."
5,This was a reasonable replacement for a broken tablet.
4,Purchased this tablet for my two year old son. It is easy for him to use and has been surprisingly durable. Would recommend the replacement plan if purchasing for a child.
5,"Better and faster than Kindle 7"". Great performance for the price."
5,"Love it, easy to operate. Very reasonable price - on sale."
4,Good product. Onboard storage does fill up quickly.
4,Bought as a gift to my dad and he likes it so far. It's fast enough for apps and great for reading
4,"Works great but the app store is nothing like that of Apple or Google. Fortunately, you can install many Android apps from 1Mobile. The screen is fabulous and it's great at its roots: making reading books fun."
4,"I love this tablet. I know it's not an iPad or any of the big tablets but it does just what I need it to do. I've had it a few weeks now. I've downloaded videos, read a few books and played some games. I've had zero problems so far. I know it's not the best video, but for the price of the tablet I don't expect it to look like my flat screen TV. I'm trying not to load too many things to keep it from slowing down. So far so good. Browsing the internet is easy too. I'm getting used to the browser and the app store for Amazon. For the price of this tablet it's not too shabby!!!"
5,You can do some many things and the best part apps for free on Amazon underground!
5,"Works great for my 6 year old. Wanted an inexpensive tablet for himsince he can be pretty rough with things. So far so good, and we love the FreeTime app."
4,Was looking to get an inexpensive tablet that ran Android. The Amazon Fire tablet was a much better value than other similar products. Have been very happy with the tablets durability and quality so far too. Would recommend to anyone looking for a lower-end tablet.
5,Bought 2 for each of our teenagers and they just love it... Very cool reading features and zero buffering while watching Netflix.
4,Good quality product. Clear display and easy to use.
5,"My mother, husband, and daughter all enjoy using Fire. It's a great way to stay preoccupied."
5,Out of all the tablet choices out there we buy these for our children over any other. You can't beat the price and durability.
5,very good product and right on the cost! Great gift for the holidays.
4,Purchased this for reading and the price. Good value for money.
5,"Great for reading, game playing, searching the web and social media."
5,"I really like the Fire IS 8 16gb, it is fast and smooth."
4,Does everything a regular tablet can and for the price you really can't beat it
5,This is so easy to use and does exactly what I hoped.
5,Great tablet for streaming ! good internet connection along with a nice display
5,Bought it as an e-reader. Convenient and easy to use. Text is very readable. I am pleased.
4,"This is a nice little tablet for the $60 I paid on black Friday. At the regular price I would probably have gone with something a little less restricted and without so much Amazon content. The lock screen ads aren't much of a problem, I understand Amazon sells these cheap and gets it back via ads, but the 15-20 Amazon apps are a little much. It would be easier to stomach if you could add the ones you want or remove the ones you don't. That said, I was able to install the Google Play store and this tablet does everything I need it to do. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the purchase. It's a nice new toy. One note: In the online photos the magenta looks purple. It's actually pink. If you like purple, get a black one and a purple case."
5,So cool after playing with this for a while now I would never spend the money on an apple for what I am doing with it.
5,Love the new fire hd 8. Price is amazing and if you are an amazon prime mbr its even better! Great for the kids as you can lock their profiles to a kids mode and they can't buy anything. If i had one downfall its the smaller amount of apps available than apple or google play.
5,"Had the Fire HD 7"" before and just wanted to upgrade. Loving it so far and really enjoying the bigger screen!"
5,The tablet is not for me it is for a Christmas gift
5,This was a great buy for my son. He needed something that he could easily transport and that woudl allow him to access the internet and various forms of media. This was a perfect choice since he also has a amazon Prime account.
5,"This was replacement for my wife's original iPad and broken Kindle Paperwhite. She loves it, as it does basically everything both of the previous devices did in one unit that is easy to use, has good battery life, very nice screen resolution and good size for her. Great value, especially compared to an iPad."
5,for the price this is a great works well the for the price display is hd love it
5,"for the money, you will be well pleased, I think it is a big bargain !"
5,"I purchased this tablet for my mother, but I set it up and tested it out. It is super fast! I have the original Kindle Fire and all I can say is Amazon has come a long way! The new Fire HD8 is so much better than the original! I like it so much that I am thinking of purchasing one for myself! I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone!"
4,"I have had a Kindle before, and needed a new one as the old one would no longer charge very well. Still adjusting to some different features from the original one. Do not like the fact that it is difficult to find a case for this one."
5,"Very happy with this purchase, it was exactly what I was looking for"
5,"My original Kindle Fire no longer accepted a charge. I wasn't going to replace it, because I bought an iPad. When I saw the HD8 in a kiosk in a BB store, I realized how much better I liked the size and feel of it for reading books (the iPad is preferred for other things). This Fire's clarity is much improved over my old one, plus it responds better. I don't like that I can't choose a photo for the locked screen - that it HAS to be an advertisement. I also don't like that it usually takes a few trys to unlock. Menial issues from my perspective."
4,"It's a good starter tablet, to bad it runs on the Amazon OS."
4,Got this for my sister as a Christmas present and she loved it.Easy to use and great for books.
5,"This is my third Kindle, I still have the other two; however, this has a camera and much larger screen. I would take this product any day over a tablet."
4,Look forward to hearing more from my grandkids so far they love it
4,"Good small tablet for all purposes for reading, playing games"
5,My wife and kids love easy to use and the size is perfect
5,Great tablet for beginners! Very light and screen is wide. Enjoy using for travels.
4,Fast processing great battery reads to me when my eyes bother me. Expandable memory a big plus.
4,The new kindle fire hd is good and my son loves it
5,Got this for my grandmother and she absolutely loves it.
4,She loves to use it to watch Netflix and play games
5,This is just the right size and can put games on it just like an iPad.
4,I wanted a new kindle fir a while. The price was right
3,"The display is not as sharp and vivid as they say but still good. Probably better for reading than watching videos. We didn't really get it for the games, but there is a good selection. WiFi works well and internet browsing is fast."
5,The Kindle is a great way to read and watch videos with ease!
4,Exciting tablet still amazed by the ease of use great product all in all
4,"Couldn't beat the value for this with the Black Friday price. They aren't the best tablets, but they do a lot for the price."
5,"great size,sound and battery. just buy it already."
4,Love the tablet mainly use for games and internet. Grrat product foe the price.
4,"She hasn't used the it yet, but my son did a quick check and it seems just fine."
5,"I've had my other Kindle Fire for 5-6 years. It's still working but slowing down. I bought the updated version while it was on sale. I love it! I play games on it, download books, check my email and facebook. It's like a portable mini computer and I wouldn't be without it. I like it better than other people's tablets and you can't beat the price. I bought some for gifts and everybody loves it! I'd recommend it to people of all ages."
5,"Great product, no complaints at all,good for kids and adults"
4,"At ninety dollars, the expectionations are low, but this is still a very good table, it's good for light use like watching videos or web browsing, but the camera is a bit lacking, and at certain times the device can freeze or lag. Overall this is a good tablet for $90, I would recommend this to anyone on a budget."
3,Good starter unit. Easy for a beginner to use. Priced low to give you a taste of the tablet world.
4,"The Parental Options need some work. You can't even log in to a child account until you have Apps loaded for them to use. Also a kid's login doesn't have access to pre-loaded apps (like the calculator). Seems really odd to me that you can't give them access to basic functionality of the tablet.Otherwise, the tablet itself works great."
5,"Bought a Fire HD 8 tablet for my wife. She doesn't like using computers and avoids smartphones, but her new tablet is a big hit. She uses it to play games and to stream movies and radio programs. I use it for everything else -- reading news, checking e-mail, online shopping, etc. It was very easy to set up and even easier to use. Plenty of speed and capacity to do everything we want."
5,We already own kindles so we know they are great ! My son is going to live this!
5,I purchased 2 of these FIre HD tablets as gifts. They pack a lot of punch for the price. I helped set them up so I was able to get an idea of how they are going to work. The screen was very nice and clear. Speed of tablet was good. It is easy to use. If you are already in the Amazon family through prime it is a no-brainer.I don't believe you can get a better tablet at this price point.
5,I bought these as a starter online browser. It is a very portable pad . Great price.
5,Just what my wife wanted and needed she loved it! It is easy to use and simple to set up!
5,Good tablet for the money. A good add on if you have Amazon prime
4,You can't beat the price. Great deal for what you're paying.
5,We bought it for our 9 yr. Old daughter and she loves it. We do as well. Kindle tablets are great!
5,"its fast, it has good lighting. its got the 16gb space, best gift ive bought for a bookreader."
4,I love it.....Reading E books here is so easyPerfect for price
5,"With a $20 off deal last blackfriday, who will not get it. Much clearer and faster than the other fire HD. Light weight too"
2,"If you shop on Amazon all the time, this will help make it easier still. Lots of ads pop up, and you can't use apps from non-Amazon sources unless you root it, and that is complicated. This is not a realistic alternative to an iPad or Galaxy Note. If you just want to a device to shop on Amazon with, you'll love it."
5,This is my 2nd Fire tablet. I will alwyas need one. Just wish they lasted longer than 4 years.
2,fire tablet is very powerful for the size and does everything!
5,"While there are some apps that are missing due to not using the Google Play Store the list is minimal. The tablet itself is quick, responsive, and noticeable nicer than the 7"" fire. Picked this up when it was on sale for black friday sales. It's great for in front of the TV and catching up on email and light web browsing."
5,Price was fabulous for an entry level tablet. Right on
5,Was impressed how quick and responsive touch and overall speed.Including Alex app.fit in top coat pocket
5,"I have been buying Kindles since they first came out. When ever I want to upgrade Kindle is my chosen brand. I am not very tech savvy and I enjoy watching movies, listening to music and primarily reading. I like the ability to purchase narration for my favorite titles and using text-to-speech for the rest."
4,Have not used these yet as they are Christmas gifts
5,Wife loves this thing. She reads nonstop on it. She can't put it down
4,Nice for the price had to put Google play store on myself but still a nice tablet
5,"This is a really good tablet for adults but especially great for kids as you can load movies or add apps that they can use. The cost is so low you just can't beat it. Plus, the main feature for me was the Amazon Kindle name on the product which puts it way ahead of the no name tablets on the market. Great product and gift."
5,I purchased two of these on Black Friday. What a great purchase. These are very inexpensive and have the ability to do so many things for the kids. I later bought tough cases to keep any damage minimal.
4,I love my kindle. I bought the larger screen after owning 2 previous 7 inch screens.
5,this tablet has the best battery ive ever seen. The picture is great too.
5,LIke that there are lots of apps to choose from. Very user friendly
4,"I wanted a new tablet and saw the 7"" on sale at Christmas, my husband was offered the 8"" for just $10 more, so good value ! Thin and light weight. Easy to start up. I would have liked to have a booklet on featuers and use, etc. Nothing in print came with it other than one paper . Tutorials on set up and where the buttons and slots were. I have enjoyed the quick loading to start, just wish I had a physical booklet on how to's, not just online tutorials."
4,More features In several ways than iPad. This android tablet is really powerful
5,"I bought this for my wife because she plays a lot of games along with my grandson, this is perfect to download all the games they want without taking up space on her iPad."
5,Great to take with me when I need alone time to just surf and read.
4,Love the tablet! Easy to use and easy to take with
5,Awesome tablet! Love using it to read and surf the web.
4,"It matters what preference you prefer with tablets. I mean if you use windows or google more this might not be for you. For me, I use Amazon music, video, books, and shopping so this tablet is awesome. It's made especially for Amazon ecosystem users. Its light and has a nice feel. I live the blue shade option it has for less blue light when reading."
5,Enjoy having the kindle. My son uses all the time for reading. It has helped him improve in his reading skills. We are glad we bought it. Thank you.
5,"This was one of the best birthday presents, I ever purchased for my husband. He said he doesn't use the computer, but he was on my smartphone daily viewing FB. I got him a drone for Christmas and he needed something to view, while it is flying. I researched the Kindle Fire and thought he could practice with it until spring. He farms, so isn't busy in the winter. Thank goodness, because he is busy with his Kindle for hours every day. He thinks it is great and I do too, because now I have my phone back."
5,"I really enjoy reading. So much so I was running out of shelf space. I have read a few books with my I-pad mini but it really didn't do the trick. No so with my new Amazon Fire Hd-8. Handy sized, not the least bit heavy and super bright. Add in the face that digital material from magazines to novels are often as not far cheaper that ""hard copies""."
5,Amazing video quality easy to maneuver wonderful screen size easy set up
4,Great tablet other than the photo image quality is fuzzy and not the best.
5,The Fire HD8 strikes an excellent balance between performance and price. It has many of the features you'd want in a tablet for a fraction of the cost. Works flawlessly for reading and video streaming.
5,"This is my second Kindle and I love it. It's lightweight, simple, and fast. It's convenient for trips and fits in my bag without weighing it down."
5,Bought this as a gift. My mother likes it. It's easy and simple to use.
5,I am loving my fire tablet and I am using it everyday at home and at work on break
4,I will be ordering Amazon fire for my two granddaughters because they love Nana's so much
4,Really beautiful display is great for watching movies and playing games. It is very powerful for the price and you can play lots of games from Amazon for free - they even remove microtransactions from lots of games.Only downside is you need Amazon Prime to get the most out of your tablet
5,"Very little set up, Amazon helpful in setting up the functions. Clear pictures and easy to use. Take pictures both ways"
4,Graphics are great for the price. Would highly recommend.
5,"Bought this for my mom and it was just what she needed and at a great price. Been wanting to get an Ipad for myself, but think this might be a great less expensive option for me as well."
4,The pad worked as I thought but the screen wasn't as vibrant as our iPads. Still a great deal for the price.
5,Perfect thing I needed to read books on and play my games
5,"I'm loving the tablet so far. I really like the Amazon underground, and the Fire OS just updated, so it has Alexa on it now. :)"
5,this tablet is perfect for surfing the internet and following social media
4,"I like the shape and size of this Kindle, and the graphics are good. But if I play a game for very long the charge seems to run out pretty quickly. It is very good for books and for music. I would recommend it for those categories."
5,For its price. Amongst the others I felt this was a deal
5,Perfect size and very responsive. I have 4 of them.
5,"No issues runs games and internet well. ,,,,,,,,,,,,"
4,It is very easy to use for children . We have loved having one and are hoping to buy another one for kids Christmas !!
4,good price for the product. I purchased for my middle school son.
1,"not good, hate it , never buy it again, sucks. done"
5,"Smartphone works on the job for me, but with the Fire I can read instructions and worksheets. It is a useful tool for connecting with both friends and colleagues. 8-inches is the right size for holding in hand and carrying with you. Gives me the information, beats printing everything out, or carrying around a large laptop."
5,Think this will be a great product for my parents it is a Christmas gift.
5,"The Amazon fire tablet is an excellent product. I primarily use it to purchase and read books from Kindle. Also, I use it for my Facebook activity. The battery life is long and it recharges quickly. My 10 year old son also enjoys using it. I would highly recommend this product to others."
5,"My husband is a truck driver and being on the road away from home, he likes to have shows and movies to watch. This has so much space for him to download things to watch."
4,"A great Kindle reader. Easy to order, read and store books. Also speedy for finding Amazon products and ordering them. But the other apps are really slow - too slow."
4,Easy to use as a tablet and easy to use as a ebook reader
4,"Not sure if this is due to the new version but I'm not able to install or even sideload certain apps onto the tablet. Amazon is really trying to lock out non-Amazon apps namely ones from Google. Aside from that though, performance is already and what you'd expect from a tablet in this price range. This was purchased for my mom and it does what's needed and my mom has no complaints thus far."
4,Tablet is working good for what we wanted it to do.
4,"Still waiting for Alexa to function. Several calls to Amazon supportled to conflicting answers on how to get it to work, then told it isnot yet available on all Fire HD 8 tablets."
4,"The Amazon Fire Hd8 has great features. The size is perfect to carry anywhere. Excellent apps and accessible to books, movies, games etc. Clear screen. it was very quick and easy to setup and begin using."
5,"I have had several budget tablet, but this blows them all away. You have to be willing to be invested in the Amazon ecosystem, but it is well worth it."
4,This tablet is a good one for everyday use. It is small but it has a clear image. Not sure if I really wanted one this small but its ok for now.
4,"This does not run Android, so no Google Play store. Amazone apps are moztly the same titles, but not all are available that you can get through Google Play. Bought this for our daughter and she enjoys it. If you have an Amazon Prime subscription you can get a lot more out of this tablet as well."
5,"Bought for daughter, love the parental control and curfew setting"
5,I like the portability of it. I take it with me when I babysit my granddaughter.
4,bought as a gift she loves it great with amazon prime
5,Had the previous version of this tablet and was looking to upgrade. Got this on sale and am very pleased.
5,My daughter love this tablet! Easy to use and carry
5,"The best kindle fire ever, love how quickly the apps run, being able to watch movies, listen to music, etc. on it"
5,The salesman was very good pointed us in the right direction. The tablets are perfect for our triplet grandsons.
5,Excellent value for the price. Super easy to use and set up. Wonderful display. I love the fact that you can add an sd card for more memory unlike the old Kindles. Plus I'm really impressed with the fact the Amazon has such great offers.
5,"I love my kindle. It fast, great pict quality and is so convenient to use. I love using it to watch Netflix. It worth the purchase if you don't want to spend so much money."
5,I love this tablet!! Excellent quality speakers and screen. Lots of storage space. Worth the money!!
5,Bought it for my husband and he loves it. This is perfect for what he wanted it for.
5,Very fast and super easy to use I'm very pleased with this purchase!!
5,It's works really well and don't have any issues at all
4,Tablet is good for beginners and those that like to read
5,The Kindle Fire has great features for the price. The video quality is asstounding.
4,"It worked really well for me as I am unschooled in ipads. I used it while traveling and it was easy to use and did the things I needed, i.e. maps, books downloaded, internet access, youtube, etc.. I don't play games, so cannot comment on that."
5,If you want a tablet to use on a daily basis for facebook or do online purchases you couldn't ask for a better tablet.
5,"I use to read books, watch movies, and get online.. it works great and easy to use."
4,I bought this to replace a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. I absolutely love the Kindle HD 8. It was easy to set up and very easy to find my way around. The only reason I took off 1 star is that I have found some apps are not available for Kindle. But so far from info I have read online there are ways to resolve this issue.
4,Just a simple kindle. Doesn't have the glass back.
5,Throughly enjoying my fire tablet. Can play games and read books. Am very pleased with it.
5,"Excellent screen , fast response. Almost a steal for that price."
3,Much harder to work than an android. None of the wallpaper apps I downloaded from the kindle store work on the device. many of the other apps look cheap on the display. other wise it is prettier and more responsive than the cheaper $49 tablet. They make it look like an android tablet but it is not. no google play. Everything is just harder to work than on a regular android BUT for a tablet under $100 it exceeds expectations. It is more responsive than other models of fire
5,Kindle Fire is a dream. Larger screen easy to read
5,I HAVE BEEN WITH AMAZON PRIME FOR 2 YEARS AND THIS NEW FIRE HD MAKES IT WORTH IT. i WATCH MOVIES WHEN I FLY BECAUSE I CAN DOWNLOAD THEM. THE BATTERY LAST FOR DAYS. I USE IT EVERYDAY NOW.
4,"Well worth the 80 bucks, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member. You can download and watch anything on there for free, including movies and magazines. The screen is a bit on the darker side, but the battery life is great. I have both an IPAD and this, and I use both. Great when you are waiting for your IPAD to recharge..."
5,"Reading is easy, can make font as large as you need"
4,Improved over the HD 7. Things set up differently but not hard to learn. Also a bit heavier than the 7 so reading in bed a little harder
5,"Not to much to complain about. for less than 100 dollars you get an 8in tablet that has pretty good specs; expandable storage, long battery life, great speakers, fast processor, decent cameras and hi def screen. easy to use and well built tablet....The only knock is the included adds but, after using it for awhile you barely notice it."
4,I've purchased a number of Kindle Fire products for family over the past several years and continue to use them. Easy to use for even my youngest Grandchildren or my 87 year old Mother-In-Law which they use as a reader and for games. An overall good value.
5,This is the fastest booting tablet I have come across. The speed at which I can access sites is really amazing.
5,"I went into bestbuy to purchase a replacement after mine died. I loved my kindle, and decided to get 2-in-1 with the fire. It is perfect for my needs."
3,"I had fire hdx 8 and loved it, unfortunately got damaged and could not replace. I purchased the fire HD 8 and exchanged n pay difference for fire HD 10. The 8 did not have a lot of options I was used to. :("
5,great product at a great price.i like the builtin filter which is easy on youreyes.probably the best reader under 100 dollars.
5,Very good product. Super quality and the Best Buy store rep explained me about the product
5,This is my third Kindle Fire and it improves each time. Colors are crisper and best of all it stays charged a lot longer.
5,"I bought this for my sister, who already had the Kindle 7. For the price the 8 is better. First the obvious. a inch more screen does make a difference and the HD makes reading and streaming alot clearer. Being able to add more storage with a micro SD card is a huge plus as well. This device includes a camera! And last at under 100.00 makes this a huge value for a great tablet."
5,Excellent. Just as good as iPad with a fraction of the price.
3,"The Amazon Fire HD8 (2016 model) is a great tablet for the price; however, the Fire OS offers limited abilities to the user. Personally, I wish there were ways to mirror the screen to a tv without having to purchase a Fire TV streaming stick. Also, the inability to use the google play store is a major set back. If it weren't for those two complaint, I'd give this tablet 4 stars."
5,I really love the new shape and size of the kindle HD. My daughter uses it and can control it great.
5,"I'm loving this new fire, mainly because I didn't fork out a couple hundred for it. My only beef is that magazines are formatted for the demensions of an iPad so don't look great on this"
5,Love my tablet easy to work and have no problem with down loads.and lite weight.
4,"Works okay as a tablet and especially to access Amazon.No good as a general tablet as there are no Google apps available, such as Chrome, gmail, etc."
5,I love this Kindle. I love the fact that you can use an SD card for more storage. Great job
5,The device is priced just right to give as a gift for an 8 year old
5,We have had a hard time with tablets and our 8 year old who has been down loading apps since she was around 3-4 years of age so far this tablet has survived everything except the constant draining of battery when used by her .
4,"I believe it depends on how you want to use it. I bought this for my young kids and they are loving it. They can do basic stuff like surf the internet, watch youtube and play some games. The only complaint that I have is that sometimes it does not charge, even if you have have it connected for the whole night. You just have to restart the pad so that it can charge, but that is the only glitch."
4,"Works well. I really like the bigger screen (up from the 7""). Easier to read, just as easier to use if not better."
5,"This tablet is great for anyone who uses this for the basics.Load times can be a bit slow for browsing the web or streaming videos, but once it's loaded, it plays without buffering as long as you got internet speeds that are good enough. This tablet is a good size and great for pictures, downloaded videos and music. For its price, it makes a pretty good gift for someone wanting their first tablet."
5,"Bought one for the kids to use while we travel, lots of good free games. Installed VLC media player from the app store and filled up the SD drive with movies. Now they are nice and quite for hours on end.Battery life is awesome!"
5,Can't beat the value on this. 5 stars even though it has less apps than the play store.
4,"I bought my Fire HD8 as an alternative to carrying around my laptop and having to buy many textbooks for college. The fact that I saved well over $150 on one of the 5 books I had to get this semester was a godsend. Most all undergraduate courses I have seen are offered in eBook form for Kindle. If you do not care about having the constant ability of being on the internet without WiFi or other hotspot, it's a great resource. Pros:Price for this was still less than the money saved for my Biology Book.A lot less weight that 5 college textbooks.So far all books I need for college are available as eBooks through Amazon.A single charge can make it through an 8 hour school day.Cons:If you want/need a network connection, you have to use your phone as a hotspot or connect to another WiFi network. Bottom line, I wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over $750 in books around. I came out at well under $500 considering I bought this."
4,My only disappointment is the inability to download some of the apps I use in my phone.
5,I had the previous model which was fine for reading but a little slow for other things. The extra .5 RAM makes a difference. Very happy and if you're a Prime member there are lots of freebies!
4,"I like this tablet. It has everything you want. However the apps within it need to be updated more often. If this happened than it would be top above an iPad mini. For now, it gives me enough of what I need and in HD. For $89 it was a good deal."
4,"Great inexpensive tablet for everyday use. It's not powerful enough for super graphical games but it's great for basic apps like surfing the web, emails, news, etc. Amazon has ""underground"" apps which is totally free (including in-app purchases). Only downside with those is that you sometimes see a full screen ads in them (usually products that's on your Amazon wishlist). All-in-all, it's a great tablet that you don't have to worry about if you break it."
4,Great price of 89 dollars on a great tablet. It is very fast at everything accept game play. For example it plays asphalt 8 and the game is just barely playable. The graphics struggle on this tablet with higher graphic games. Also it is a Amazon tablet with no Google play store but you can load Google play on to it. There are great you tube videos on how to put Google play on a amazon tablet. The screen is good as long as the sun isn't hitting it. The stereo speakers sound great and loud. All in all I really liked the tablet for the price but I really like to play games with good graphic quality. So that being said I did return this tablet and ordered the Nvidia Shield 8 inch tablet through Best Buy for 199 dollars. I got the Shield a week ago and WOW!! What a difference in graphic gaming quality. This thing is just as good as an Xbox1 or ps4. The Nvidia Shield tablet is simply unbelievable for the price of 199 considering the Apple or Samsung tablets that are as fast as this tablet are at least twice the cost. Plus this dubbles as a gaming console for xbox or pc games with 4k out to you tv. The Amazon tablet is also a great tablet for normal usage but if your a gamer like me the Nvidia tablet is the tablet of choice hands down period!! I don't know why bbuy kind of hides the Nvidia tab only on their website and doesn't sell it in the store. If they displayed it in the store. This would outsell the Apple or Samsung tablets. I hope this helps thanks.
5,I find this fire much lighter and very easy to use
4,"I use this primarily as a reader; however, it has a smaller number of unread books that are not in the familiar ""carousel"" as in other Kindle readers. As a tablet it is faster, brighter and more clear than other tablets that I have used for internet purposes. I would recommend this product to anyone who uses a tablet or a reader."
5,Does great on browsing and doing research easy to use and love the features especially the private browsing a great price as well
5,Great little tablet for a great price. I keep it at work for listening to music or some lunchtime reading.
4,Wanted to travel without my laptop. Found the Fire to be perfect. Used it mainly for checking email and keeping up with Facebook posts of friends. Found the size of screen to be easy to read. Typing a tad uncomfortable until one has some experience using it. Have yet to use as an ereader.
5,great tablet to replace kindle. Love the features.
5,This is a great tablet for my teen. She loves it and the price can't be beat!
4,"This is a great tablet. It has amazing storage. I use mine daily. Great for reading, surfing the web and games. The one small thing I don't like is Amazon prime shows are a bit dark for some reason. Hulu and Netflix work wonderful."
5,The kindle is great to read on. I also like that you can play some games.
5,I love the amazon tablet very much and love to use
4,its good performance and highly recommended to amazon users
5,"I bought this for my wife to replace her 7"" fire that was having a hard time holding a charge anymore. She is thrilled! It was easy for her to transfer all of her books and apps from her old fire to this. She mainly uses this for books , email and some games so this is the perfect tablet for her. better graphics and quicker with the 16gb storage"
4,"If you don't want or need something cheaper than an iPad but of quality, this is a great happy medium.The processor makes for a fluid ride with it. It's speedy. The Android Store gives you good app options and the Amazon ecosphere is everywhere here.The software is a touch buggy but it's still a great deal of a tablet.For a child, for something you want to use casually on a dime, it's recommended."
5,Easy to read. Light in weight. Has many good features.
5,"I read about this new 8"" Amazon tablet in the New York Times. My Google Nexus 7, 4 years old, was getting slower and slower, and I needed to upgrade - for as little money as possible.This Amazon Fire 8"" is an excellent value for the money(only $89!) - very fast, great screen resolution, and easy to use. I was skeptical of the Silk browser, which I'd never heard of, but it works fine. There is no ""page forward"" arrow, which is odd, only backwards, but I can live with that.It has exceeded my expectations and I'm very happy with it. I'm not in the Amazon ecosystem, this is my first foray, and it's a good one! Congrats to Amazon for making an affordable, great quality tablet!Also, the purchasing experience at Best Buy was easy and convenient, as always!"
5,"The new Fire HD 8 is an improvement over the Fire HD 7"". It is faster and the larger screen makes reading books much easier. I do wish the screen was easier to read when outside or in the car. Too much glare in those places."
5,Love it! I'm not computer savy but was able to figure out most things without any help.
5,Mother needed something since her tablet had died. Was lot easier for her to learn than her old table. She does lots more with Kindle than she did with tablet
4,Light to carry and good picture quality. This was purchased for a hearing impaired person to download video in American Sign Language . This product was easy to maneuver for someone that was not use to a tablet.
4,I love this tablet. I purchased them for gift and am so glad I did!
5,"The new Fire HD 8 tablet is a nice upgrade over the previous version. Storage doubled to 16 GB and the RAM increased by 50% to 1.5 GB. This makes the tablet faster and more responsive. With the improved battery life and much lower price, this is a great general purpose tablet."
5,I purchased it for my dad (70)He needed something easy to use. He really enjoys it.
5,"It a great product..,. The quality is awesome the pictures is good and clear..."
5,i have had not issues with my purchase. i found a great cover for it on line on amazon and use it every night. thank you for your service.
5,"This has a great picture, good size, lots of storage and a camera. Would recommend"
5,I went from the 7 inch Kindle to the 8 and it really made a difference. Easier to read and clearer than my old one.
5,"I love this Tablet. It's easy to use, a great price & lightweight."
5,"This is my second Kindle Fire HD. I was satisfied with the first one, but now I'm really enjoying the larger screen. My biggest need is to preserve the progress I've made in various games without having to replay them, but at least I have access to all my books, movies and games. Love the Kindle!"
5,"Love the product. I use it every day for Web,Games and reading."
5,"I bought this to replace my wife's (1st generation) Kindle Fire. She likes it even better than the old one, especially the pinsharp screen."
5,"Great Kindle fire, works great for reading, playing games, etc. Highly recommend to everyone."
4,"Very pleased with this device. Great price, easy to use, and light weight."
5,Nice upgrade from my old kindle. I like it very much.
5,"For the price this is perfect. I read books, search the web, watch Netflix. It's not an iPad but for the price it is amazing!"
5,Ä°t is cheap tablet option coming from amazon. Latest model will satisfy your needs
4,"Very descent for a non-IPAD. Good speakers. Great price. The screen is a little dark. Great buy if you have Amazon Prime since you can download stuff and watch it offline (great for trips, etc...). Overall great cheap IPAD or even as a back-up tablet. Terrific battery life too."
5,"This thing looks nice, runs nice and feels nice and for the price I don't think you can find a better tablet."
4,"Got this for my 9 year old after her ipad crashed and burned. She does not like androids at all but I couldn't afford a expensive tablet for her. So we took a chance with this one. She is pleased and I'm pleased it seems so sturdy , not cheap quality at all. Going to get our youngest child one now. Very pleased."
5,"The quality of display is better than expected for the price. (Keep in mind that this is not an iPad!). Apps from amazon are well integrated and the functionality is fully enjoyable without limitation. Very satisfied with the product. This review is for Fire HD 8, 16 GB."
4,I like it but I had a hard time figuring things out.Do I get to talk to geek squad free? Can I come down to the store and get someone to help me with my questions.Will there be a fee for that service?
5,"Beautiful HD resolution on this tablet. Love the 8"" size, not too big nor too small."
5,"This is an awesome tablet, fast, great display and has all the apps I need for personal entertainment If you look for a great tablet for entertainment this is the best you can have, if you want a tablet for working applications this is not the one so be aware and buy this tablet if you want tons of entertainment. also it have a larger processor and internal memory and the external memory to keep all your photos is unbelievable I strongly recommend it, again, not for work but for entertainment."
5,"I bought 2, 1 for each kid. Easy to set up and figure iut. I went with the staff member's recommendation and I am so glad I did. I love the internet safety organ on it through Amazon. $2.50 a month per kid for unlimited age related and child safe Internet access and movies, books, games and apps and I can set the time it shuts off and a minimum time for them to read each day. Love love love."
4,"Good tablet, great price, easy to use, pick up simple"
5,Very happy with my kindle. Would buy it for my kids
4,"I am a power user; there's no other way of putting it. I work in IT and I research the heck out of products before I buy. I had an iPad Mini 2 that was just not up to snuff with iOS 10 so I sold it and bought (and eventually returned) the 2016 Fire HD 8. First let me say it's a great tablet for the price and for probably 50-60% of tablet users who surf the web and watch Netflix. It also helps if you are a heavy Amazon content user. For me, I was spoiled by the retina display on the iPad. The 720p display is alright, but you can see the pixels. 189ppi is pretty low by today's standards. The other big thing for me was the lack of a laminated display. It's glare city on this thing. Display nitpicks aside, it punches above its price point. If you don't play really heavy games (which it even plays Titan Quest surprisingly well!) and you don't mind not having an absolutely beautiful screen I think it runs and works fine. It just wasn't for me. I bit the bullet and went with a 128GB iPad Air 2 as its on special at BB for super cheap right now."
1,This is not a bad product. Amazon offers greats products but this tablet was missing features even for a basic tablet. The lack of google chrome compatibility made this tablet not right for me.
5,"So I got my Fire HD 8 originally for ebooks since e-copies are much cheaper. Very easy to use, especially if you are not tech friendly. So glad I got this."
3,"This was a good tablet. I bought it for my Gf who basically only wanted it for Netflix and YouTube. The display was good, not great. The issue we had was that it kept dropping the wifi connection. This could have been a defect in this one tablet but we returned it and got another one."
5,"Bought the Kindle for my daughter. It's the 4th we have bought over the years, one for each child. Great product"
4,"GREAT value for the cost - not as fast as a high end tablet, but certainly faster than I was expecting. Clear viewing and easy navigation"
5,"Husband loves the 8"" tablet. The screen is big enough to view what he is reading"
5,For first tablet I am pleased. An amazon name is good value.
4,Excellent price point for my basic requirements. It has all the features I need for comfortable reading of online novels and articles.
5,This is a good product for the price. Many more things can be done with this fire 8 than we dreamed about.
5,Easy access to my Amazon account. Easy to set up and use.
5,"This item has a very nice readout, and is well built as far as I can tell. The overall size is very suitable, and the price was reasonable. I get great service at Best Buy every time I shop there."
5,Does everything I needed and moreI use it as a travel companion and the size is great.
5,Its so perfect for my niece & she loves it. Going to get another one for my son.
5,the performance is so much faster than my old one and the graphics are much better too.
5,Love my kindle it does everything I wanted I to do.
5,"I wanted a tablet that was easy to use that I could access my email, internet and stream shows/movies! It's perfect!"
5,As expected. I am very happy with this. This serves the purpose
5,Handy to use and size is good. It's light weight and that's important.
5,I got this for my husband birthday and he loves it
5,This kindle is great. Battery lasts much longer than old kindle.
5,"Where do I begin...good clarity, I love the size and storage capacity! Very affordable, love watching Netflix on it. I do wish I could have gotten the purple, got the color black, but overall I'm very happy with my purchase."
5,"I didn't think to much of it at first glad at the store, I decided to purchase it. IT WAS THE BEST DECISION EVER MADE"
4,I bought the Fire HD 8 & CaseI use it mostly for class..works very good..would be better if it had BlueTooth.
4,We have several kindles and this is the latest version. Its packed with Amazon marketing stuff which is fine if you use them but most just take up space for us. This new version comes with 16gb but allows you to expand the memory with an sd card which is great. One problem if you have a few other kindles is that they are linked to your account so if they are for different family members/kids they may end up with the same stuff on them. My kids mainly use them for game apps and YouTube videos which am seem to work great. The sound is good and the hd video is nice. Overall happy with it and the price was good for this type of tablet.
5,I went into Best But to buy another reader but ended up buying a Fire 8; good value and has the things I need in a reader.
5,Got the tablet for my grandson he's happy with it and use it as we speak
1,We bought this earlier on line from another vendor and it was never delivered. Best Buy was great.
5,Great buy. Bought it for my 10 year old niece. She loves it.
2,"I have always gone to buy a kindle because I like the books and th games available. But I found them very unpredictable and unreliable. The color burns futon screen, then the screens starts jumping. As a result I have purchased 8 over the years. Not sure if Want to go through that for the 9th time!"
4,"It's good, saves using up data usage on computer. I use it to keep up to date with the news."
5,"The Kindle Fire HD has a larger screen (8"" vs. 7"") and images are crisper with more vibrant colors."
5,Just lock the card out and let the kids go crazy!!
5,This is an awesome tablet perfectly for watch tv for my little nephew
4,My kids enjoy reading books and playing games on the fire tablet.
5,I'm so glad i brought this because it is very handy and easy to use too. Everything about it is good and I really like it.
4,"At the price it is almost an impulse buy. I wanted a tablet for an upcoming trip to watch some movies, read, etc and this was at a price point that made the decision really easy. If you are used to an iPad, the Fire HD is a little disappointing but it costs considerably less. It fit my needs but I felt some slugginess and several instances of needing to reboot to get certain apps to work correct. If you go in with the understanding this isn't an iPad replacement this should fit the bills for you. Let's just say, after my trip I purchased an iPad Pro and this item will likely be handed off to one of my children. If you have Amazon Prime, you do get some nice perks that make this a really nice item."
4,Easy to follow directions allowed her to set it up with me watching over her shoulder.
5,I purchased this tablet for my Autistic child. He loves it!!
5,I've enjoyed using my Fire HD8 tablet to play games.
5,"Beautiful screen, vibrant color, fast and best quality for the money."
5,I use it for downloading and reading books. It is the perfect size for this purpose. It is also very light.
4,Bought for wife who is not into the techie word. She likes it - suggest buying a protective screen and padded case for it.
2,My wife wanted an iPad. I bought her this because it was cheaper and good for reading and playing games. She uses iOS products so it's not compatible. She hardly ever uses it. Next time I'll get what she wants and not waste my money.
5,Much better screen resolution than my 7 inch fire.
5,"I bought this tablet for my Mom and she loves it. I used it myself and it's very easy to use and works nicely with Amazon Prime, etc. definitely would recommend especially for the price."
4,I enjoy using the tablet. I use it when I am biking.
5,This really a nice tablet.It runs great and it's thin and easy to hold.
5,This tablet is quick and as good as my iPad! I use the tablet specifically for one aspect of my life and it performs great! I am pleasantly surprised by its performance!
5,I have a 4 year old boy and 6 year old girl and 12 year old boy no cracks or broken yet yes they have dropped them no case but no cracks yet pretty amazing when they drop it on hard wood floors and still not broke!!
5,Wow I've had quite a few different kindles over the years and I've loved all of them. But this kindle fire hd 8 is by far my favorite. So glad my husband bought it for me the best purchase ever.
5,"Upgraded from a standard Fire tablet. Better screen, a bit faster than standard Fire."
5,In my opinion this the absolute best value on a tablet out there. No way to go wrong at this price
5,the new sound and the faster speed plus other improvments are great
5,"I am very happy with this Amazon tablet. I purchased it for business purposes, as well as recreational, and it works great for both. I did get an SD card for more memory. Also, if I would have bought directly from Amazon, there would've been a 1 month wait. However, I was able to order from Best Buy online, and pick it up that very day!!!"
5,Its perfect to see my tv series when i don't have my tv around. It has a very good resolution quality.
5,"I bought the 8"" to replace my old 7"". I love the bigger screen"
1,Freeze frequently... No way to trouble shoot or repair it...
5,I got myself 1 of these tablets and so far I love the way it works You can enlarge the print and change the lighting to make it easier to read. The only thing with it is you must have an Amazon account to use it.
5,This kindle rocks! Tons of storage at an awesome price.
5,bought it as a gift for my mother and she loves it
5,I love the fire....it works great and the navigation through the Fire is user friendly too. I think the 8 is the better buy for your money.
5,"BY FAR THE BEST TABLET IVE EVER OWNED, EASY AND QUICK SET UP"
5,This tablet is very good especially considering the price. also has memory slot to increase storage.
5,I bought this tablet over the holidays when it was on sale. It has been a great tablet. The battery life is great on these new models. Also playing games everything moves smoothly since it has more ram. The durability of the tablet is great. This thing won't break if you drop it. The only thing I don't like is the fire os. You can't get everything you can get on the google store so not all apps are available.
5,I have had a few kindle's in the past so this was nothing new for me but what I loved about this one is that the screen is big so when I am reading a book it's a lot easier than when I had the first kindle screen. I mostly use it just for the reading but being able to navigate the internet on it is great for when I want to look something up about the book real quick or if you want to search reviews on a book before purchasing. I love it!
4,Purchase this tablet during the Christmas sale. This tablet is a good tablet for a beginner. Easy to use and shows movies and videos very well.
5,Great tablet for on the go. Good size screen to watch movies or read book.
5,"Light, portable and great features. Highly recommended."
4,"For the price and features offered on the tablet, I wouldn't purchase any other tablet. I enjoy using it and overall find it fairly easy to navigate. Easy internet browser with ""Silk"" and convenient access to all the applications I am interested in."
5,Bought it for a friend he likes it.would recommend it.
5,This tablet was everything I was looking for: a cheap tablet that could download Netflix shows for offline viewing
5,"Unlike my first Kindle, this tablet gives me all kinds of information, advertisements and offers when I first turn it on. I could live without that, but overall, I am pleased with this new tablet. It does many things I haven't taken the time to explore, but hope to soon."
4,"This is a great tablet for the price. Would give it 5 stars if it had included some sort of instruction manual. Otherwise, definitely recommend."
5,This is a great tablet with great features. I love my kindle.
5,Can't beat the price on this tablet! Great for streaming or casual games.
4,Great for reading and Netflix. Fits nice in purse. Good price.
5,Good value at a very affordable price. Can't beat it.
4,Works great prety fast operating system dosent heat up
5,We love this so much in our home. We bought a super tough case and let our two and six year old use it. They love watching their movies on it and playing different apps. It is a really good value!
5,"Great tablet! Brought this for my wife and she loves reading off of it! Great price, easy to use! Great purchase!"
5,"Very fast, very functional. Love the e-reader function. Movies, music and internet work great. LOVE IT!"
5,"I received this as a gift from my husband. It's great for reading, gaming and watching Netflix."
4,"I exchanged a highly unsatisfactory Insignia unit for the Fire. I was looking for a 10 inch screen, but went to the smaller size for performance. I have no complaints with the Amazon product, other than the ubiquitous advertising."
5,My daughter loves her tablet. I had to make sure I brought a case because it is very thin. No problems and I can see everything she downloads
5,"Have a fire 7 and wanted a bigger screen, love the new one."
5,Perfect for our needs and an on the go mini computer and ereader.
3,"This tablet is great for books, audible books, music and all things Amazon. The included browser (Silk) is not the best. I purchased expanded memory (64GB SD card) for about $30 more and a cover for about $20. The biggest issue I have with this unit is that it is slow (when compared to an iPad) and it tends to freeze every so often. For about 2.5x more money, consider an iPad instead."
4,Great tablet use it for reading and email. Great price!
4,Nice little tablet. Functional and easy to use.Fits the needs that I need to use it for.
4,Awesome.and repeat 50 times. That should do it. Blah.
5,"I initially bought the tablet for school, I use Kindle to rent books but after using it to stream Xfinity, Netflix, and Amazon Prime I loved the sound and picture quality. I would recommend this to anyone needing a good low cost tablet with great battery life."
5,We have had no issues with this tablet. Love it!TY
4,For the price it's a bargain. This is a perfect solution for a reader and simple browsing. I use this at night before bed.
5,My first tablet experience and it's awesome. I love being able to stream movies and have numerous apps at my fingertips.
4,Bought this for my wife and she loves it! This was our third kindle over a period of many years'Can't go wrong for the price.
5,Love this tablet. Power lasts long. Short charge time. HD screen is really clear. Only con is that there are some apps not available like Google play. Very satified. Have a 128gb card in mine . Plenty of space for downloads. The camera has no flash and is not the best but I didnt buy this tablet for that. High recommend the HD tablet 8gb amazon fire. You want go wrong.
5,This tablet does all the things I really need. I have it some thought before buying I don use most of the features a more expensive computer/tablet has. Have been very happy with my purchase.
5,Got this for my wife's birthday. She had an older model and wanted an upgrade. She seems very happy with it and uses it every day
5,Very user friendly...long lasting battery....very clear display
3,"Worse graphics, won't keep a wireless connection,overall not satisfied"
5,Easy to transfer my stuff from my old Kindle into this new one. Love the price and how easy it is to use. Great buy.
5,"This is my first kindle. It works great for my use. Mostly reading, email, and Amazon shopping."
5,"Amazon Fire HD8 is one of the best deal at 89$. Strong, efficient, low price and some Amazon features that I love. Youtube videos of how to get googleplay and android apps have made things lot more easier. And now, microsoft office is available online for free that I can access and edit my documents. What else do I need? Amazon is more respectable brand name than other low price brands or used/old models of high price brands. Definitely recommend it."
5,I held off getting a tablet and wish I had done it sooner. The Amazon Fire 8 is great and easy to use
4,"i have been looking at tablets for a long time, most of them a little expensive for what i would use it for. This tablet lets me read, email, searches and the best part I can buy books through amazon and not have to carry heavy books with me when i travel"
4,"Not the highest quality of tablet out there, but for the price you almost can't beat it, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member."
4,I liked the screen size and easy to read books at night. The battery has a long life. The outer rcase could be stronger because concerned about durability.
5,Works great for everything we want our daughter to do
5,"it's wonderful. I love it. It's easy to watch movies, play games and read books."
5,love it just like my other one just better!!! since I already own a kindle I knew this was what I wanted. Just needed a second one and a little bigger. Always loved the service and help I get at BB so I knew I would purchase it there!! Found salesman to be knowledgeable and most helpful. Thanks so much for your help and service
4,New Kindle replaced my old Kindle that had a lot of books. To my surprise the book transfer worked well. Seems to work surfing the net. Music sound is only okay.
4,Great little device that does almost everything a Tablet does. I use it as my computer when I travel as well as a reader.
4,Has meet all my needs plus some. Recommend you buy a good stylus pen at the same time.
5,It fits just right in your hand. Light weight. Love it
5,I extremely happy with my purchase. I like that the screen is just a little bigger and much faster.
5,"Good picture, works well, great variety of apps. keep in mind that you get apps from amazon, not google play, so they aren't always the same or same price"
5,"This replaced my old Kindle Fire. I have not yet explored all of the features but, so far, it is performing very well. Tablet is a good size and weight, and easy to use."
5,This tablet has been the best one for the price we have purchased 3 other tabs for our kids and they have all broke and ran super slow they love them would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to save a buck but want quality
5,I would recommend this product it is a good tablet to use have had no problems.
4,"Kids love it, under $100 so the price is great. Don't have to worry about it getting mishandled as much. Still can't get them off the ipad though."
1,"I went with this tablet based on many good customer reviews, but my experience was not a good one. From the start I was on the phone every day for at least an hour with Amazon tech support for one issue or another. Most of the techs were very polite, but not all knew the product very well. At one point I asked one of them about trying to save some RAM and they kept referring me to the storage, which told me they didn't even know the difference between RAM and regular storage. The internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times, even when all my other wifi devices ran great. Then a day would pass and I'd be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop working...wtf??? Come to find out it's a ""known issue"" and ""they're working on it"". After two weeks of one thing after another I got fed up and just returned it. I wanted it to work, and gave it a good run, but just not quality stuff. To me it was like Walmart trying to build their own computer when they're obviously not a computer manufacturer, neither is Amazon. If I were you I'd look at a regular Android tablet from a reputable PC manufacturer, which is exactly what I did next. I got an ASUS tablet for only a few dollars more, and it's unbelievable. 1000% better in comparison to the Amazon Fire HD8. Save yourself the aggravation and go with ASUS or some other company that is specifically in the computer business full time. Sorry Amazon, not this time!"
3,"Not very fancy, but not slow. If you have Amazon Prime, you have a access to a great library of TV shows and Movies for free. Same goes for free book rentals. The Amazon App store is not so great, lots of apps are outdated but still work. Just not the latest versions you would expect. But the Amazon Underground appstore does offer free access to games you would normally pay for. It's decent for it's price and a good deal if you don't want anything fancy."
5,I love my Kindle fire. Had a Kindle and it disappeared. Enjoy not having to go to library for books. I get a great selection of books every day.
4,Light weight and easy to use. Very user-friendly. Durable.
5,For the price the tablet can not be beat. I use this over my ipads that i have. There is nothing i cant do with this tablet
5,I recently upgraded to this tablet; it is everything I wanted. Highly recommend!
4,It was a good buy and tried this for a day. It was fast and experience was good.
4,"I purchased this tablet knowing exactly what my needs were and how well the Kindle could meet them. Despite the ""walled garden"" philosophy that tethers you mostly to Amazon products and services, the ability (as of right now) to side-load the Google Play Store makes this a surprisingly versatile device for the price point."
5,This is a great tablet for the price! I bought it to replace my iPad mini. Great for ereading and general browsing.
5,"This replaced a Kindle 7 HDX with 32GB of ram. The older tablet had a charging port that wasn't functioning anymore. Had the Geek Squad warranty so they issued a full credit for the old tablet and my son chose the HD8 as his new tablet. Other than the screen resolution being lower and less memory, great tablet. My son didn't care about the resolution and the new Kindles let you pop in an SD card for more storage. Popped in a 64GB SD card and he's a happy camper now.. ;)"
5,"I purchased this as a gift but have had extensive time with it. It's a great budget tablet, phenomenal screen and a very smooth interface. Handles all apps and HD content well."
5,This was a birthday gift to my husband. He really likes it and it does what he needs it to do
5,"I ""retired"" an earlier version and this new souped up model more than meets my needs, and the battery lasts so much longer!!"
5,I have a kindle and wanted more options. I love the bigger screen. I find it easy to read. It can have some reflection under lights but not much.
4,"This tablet is easy to set up, has great resolution, and is perfect for reading books or surfing. The price is affordable, too. It is perfect for anyone who wants a fun and casual way to use technology."
4,"This was bought to replace my old Kindle with keypad, and experimental internet. Was surprised how much the Kindle had changed, and at the same price as my old one was when I bought it!Have already shown it to a couple of friends who now say they are thinking about getting one."
4,Really enjoying my new tablet. I like to travel and me and my family use it to play game and watch movies. Just the right size to.
5,Liked this Kindle upgrade. The color screen and backlights allowed for easy night use
4,"I enjoy the new kindle, only things I would like to change is the way screen darkens and lightens while reading. Not sure how to stop that. Occurs consistently. Also, would like to stop the ads seen each and every time kindle is turned on to start reading again. That is bothersome. Otherwise, am happy with the kindle."
4,I purchased the 8 inch device. Also purchased black cover.I played for it and asked if I could get it set up and was told it would be 40 more dollars. I did not have 40 more dollars so I left the store with my kindle and had someone else set it up for free. I was disappointed I had to get someone else to set up my kindle.
5,My previous Kindle was dying and I wanted a new replacement fast. I went to Amazon and while they had one it was back ordered a month. Expecting to pay more I went to Best Buy and not only found it for the same price but even better it was available at my local store and I could pick it up the same day!
4,I got this for my son to play games on soI could get my iPad back. Personally I think it's a great little tablet for kids and or for reading. Other then that it's not a high powered game playing tablet or anything to keep lots of storage on. But it works for what it's intended for andI have no problems.
5,Easy to use You cant beat it for the price you pay
5,This Kindle is larger than my old one and book reading is much easier. Some features I don't use so can't comment on them. All in all I love it.The only drawback was that the store had no covers that fit this Kindle.
2,"We purchased this as a replacement for our now-broken iPad. Though we liked the smaller size (more convenient, easier to carry, etc), the internet was sooooooo slowwwwww that it drove us crazy. Sometimes minutes to download a site (and this with no other apps open!1). Plan to go back to another iPad."
5,Tablet is great and easy to use thankfully because its my 1st tablet
5,This is an item that is easy to use for novices. My child uses it and has no issues
4,Easy to use. Pretty user friendly. It is good value for the price
5,"No problems with tablet, kids love it and the size is great"
4,"My nephews love to play with my phone. Now as anyone who has been around small humans knows they have an astounding ability to perpetually have something sticky on their hands. However, if its a rare case where they don't they will probably drop the device from the lack of said stickum. The kindel has come to my rescue as it has everything they need to be entertained. And best of all it lacks the anxiety inducing price tag for that moment when the kids demonstrate Murphy's law in action."
5,Was a present for my 14 year old grandson. He was very pleased.
4,"The Kindle fits me to a ""T"". Very quick to start. It shows how to get things done."
5,"For under $100 this 8"" tablet is a bargain. I do all I want on it like; check email, Facebook, Twitter, watch YouTube, read books, and shop on eBay or Amazon. I've been very pleased with my purchase."
5,Bought this for my wife for our anniversary she loves it
5,I love to read and this tablet work great for my needs.
3,"I know beforehand that this is not a powerful tablet. But it's the best bargain at this price point . The screen is okay if you just read books, news, or surf the websites. But if you want to enjoy videos-this is not your choice.The processor is slow and the amazon app store doesn't have all the apps like you'd expect from Google appstore- even though the OS based on android. But few tweaks let you install the Google playstore-search online for the steps.Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase. Hope this is helpful."
5,"I bought it for my grand daughter, she knew how to use it right away. You can purchase a rubber case in different colors for protection."
3,It is just an average tablet. Bit slow but is a good option for people on budget
4,Very nice for reading and watching videos. Strong wi fi is a must. Slippery to hold so buy a cover
3,Tablet stopped working after owning for two weeks. Came back on after an hour.
5,"This device is great for the price! I use it for my daughter and after having seeing the ads on amazon, I thought this would perfect for her."
5,"I think that the Amazon Kindle tablet was a great purchase for my teenage daughter and grandson, very easy to operate. It kept them entertained for hours while we were traveling on the train for vacation."
5,Great device. Works very well and use it throughout the day.Keeps me informed and great for looking up things and staying in contact.
4,"I love my kindle, I can listen to music,read my emails, or pick a book to read. Everything loads up easily."
4,"I really enjoy my new kindle, still getting used to it."
5,I have done this like 5 times now. Don't send me this ahs8n. Getting aggravating.
4,"This is an affordable tablet and works well, you just have to deal with a lot of advertising."
5,"Love how I am able to run the latest Minecraft on this device, but am not able to on a 3-year-old iPad. It seems as apple handy cap their devices. Resolution may not be the best, but for the little buggers it works fine"
5,"I love my Fire HD8 I got it because my Kindle(the original) that my husband bought me died and the Verizon Tablet wasn't working great for me. So I came down and the agent at store showed me this one, there is a learning curve but it gets better and takes a while to learn but I love it."
5,"Does all the basic stuff I need at a great price. I use it for some apps, web browsing and some video. Picked this over the Fire 7"" for the screen size, resolution and CPU/GPU. Battery life is pretty good. Ads aren't too annoying.Far cheaper than competing name-brand budget tablets while doing almost everything needed at this level and probably better supported. FireOS will always be a little behind the current Android version and I'd rather have Google Play than Amazon, but this still allows for side-loading stuff.Recommend if you're ok with living in Amazon's world and/or proficient enough to load other app stores or packages (or know somebody can)."
5,"this item work just as I expected it to, great product!"
4,"This is the third Fire we've purchased, and Amazon finally made this level memory-upgradable. That has made all the difference. I bought Fire tablets for use as a 'kid tablets', for which they work great...until you run out of memory. 8GB is practically nothing these days (I remember when having 64kb was a HUGE upgrade to my Atari!) so being able to toss in a memory card give my kids much more utility."
5,"Have a nook , this is much better has more apps and thru amazon"
5,I love the size and the HD quality. Just what I was looking for!Downloads apps really fast!
5,Never thought a tablet at this price could be this good. Totally recommended!
5,This is my sixth unit and has features many of the newer models didn't have.
5,Thank..............................................
4,"I had the original kindle fire for ten years and I loved it. But it broke on me and I decided on this one after looking at all the upgrades from the original. It let's you do so much more, but some of the tutorials (like for the internet) weren't helpful."
4,"Lightweight, nice display and not too large to carry."
4,this is the perfect size for an older person who uses it minimally.
4,"Good tablet, satisfied. One point annoying...silk browser makes Yahoo email a list and have to tap HTML to read each one...Awkward."
5,I love the apps that are on here and everything else I think it's the perfect tablet for a beginner has all of the apps that you will need
5,Love this tablet. 16GB memory but have expansion slot. Bought 128GB micro SD card for $56. Love this feature
5,I love Amazon Fire HD8... It is so easy to use and perfect for reading books on or cruising Social Media. I love that it has Alexa included on it.
4,"I love my Kindle for reading manga and comics. The fact that the graphics are worse than my phone detracts a little from the expirence, but serves to remind me that I cheaped out and bought yesterday's model. This is not a real negative, it just appeares less crisp than my phone. The increased picture size more than makes up for it in my book."
1,This thing lasted not even a month before it went dead. Going to try and take it back
5,Bought this so the grandkids could use it. They already have one at their house. My husband has been using it also & he likes it. He has never used a tablet before but he has enjoyed it.
5,This is a fantastic tablet for the price. This is a great alternative to an IPad.
5,I had an original Kindle that I replaced with this newer one. I love it!!
4,My 8 year old loves this so much to do on it. She enjoys reading on it play games .
5,I purchased this tablet for my 9 year old son and he loves it. Nice bright screen and has two speakers for pretty good sound for a tablet. Great for games and watching videos.
5,This was purchased on Black Friday as an impulse buy and we absolutely love it! It was a great price and the size of the tablet is perfect. It works great!
5,Great little tablet for someone who is always on the go.
5,I love my tablet no regrets the pic are great I recommend it!
5,It's a great item to have when you are out and about. It's easy to connect to Wi-Fi and it's small enough to fit in my purse.
5,Nice product for the price. It does what we need it to do. Easy to use and handy to have with you instead of a heavy laptop.
